Notes:

- Partners want to know how do we want to use the meeting time?
- MVP: The object is in clear view of the camera. No coverings or surroundings.
- Distances: short to medium, if app cannot find anything, it will be telling the user to move forward/in different directions. A series of pictures around the room?
- The smallest objects the app will detect are something like a key
- We are (Are we?) going to train a computer vision model?
- Rachel wants different ways of telling the user how to get to the item.
- Measuring distances in the last iteration of the project perhaps. Depth perception could be challenging.
- Rachel wants to know our deadlines or just a timeline of where we should at throughout the semester.
