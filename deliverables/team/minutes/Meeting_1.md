**MVP / Application Specification:** 
- Focus on Accessibility and Ease of use (Primary goal) 
- There will be a user accounts system (User data will be tied to accounts) 
- Users will have a wide range of options to identify their objects 
- No social networking 
- The partner wants to include a tab/interface to view a list of the user’s objects 

**Technical Details:** 
- Focus is on choosing the path with least resistance and the easiest options for the implementation of the AI features 
- Partners acknowledge risk of feasibility/functionality of the image detection (i.e. its accuracy not being good) 
- The partner does not want to rely on Bluetooth/wireless communication between the object and the user’s device
