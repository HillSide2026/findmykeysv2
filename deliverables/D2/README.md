# Find My keys
Find My Keys is a user-friendly mobile app that assists users with identifying commonly misplaced personal belongings using voice commands and image recognition through the user's phone camera. This app is particularly helpful for older adults, neurodivergent individuals, and users who have difficulties with organization, attention, and executive function, as it provides a more user-friendly solution compared to traditional key finders which emit sounds and often alienate people who are not comfortable with high-tech gadgets.

This sub-team deployment features the ability to create user accounts and manage a personal collection of objects with their respective images!
